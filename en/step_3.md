## Check your animation

For this resource you will need the animation you created in the [Animate a snow scene](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/blender-animate-snow-scene){:target="_blank"} resource. If you have not completed this resource, you can download and use the [starter snow scene](resources/starter-snow-scene.blend){:target="_blank"} instead.

+ Play your animation using the play icon or by moving the green bar on the timeline. Does the animation look as you would like?

+ Next, check whether the camera is in the right location. Press <kbd>F12</kbd> (<kbd>FN + F12</kbd>, if on a Mac) to render the scene.

You can also check what the full animation will look like from the camera's position.

+ If you are using a desktop computer, press 0 on the numpad (the small set of keys on the right hand side of your keyboard). Laptops don't have numpads so instead, select **View** > **Cameras** from the menu, then select **Active camera**

Be careful to use the view menu nearest the editor window NOT the one right at the bottom of the screen, marked with an X in the screenshot.

+ Click the **play** icon to play the animation and see it through the camera.

+ Exit the view by pressing 0 or selecting the **Active camera** menu option again.

If you are happy with the animation and everything looks fine from the camera's perspective then you are ready to render it.
